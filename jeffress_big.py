"""
In this test we create a bigger Jeffress model.

 - It consists of 180 output neurons.
 - The axonal delay between the input neurons and the inter-layer neurons are sampled from 0ms to 100ms.
 - We create the same spiketrain with 50 ms difference between the two input neurons.

Over several test runs, we adjust the weight which with the inter-layer is connected to the output layer.
One can see that the better the weights are adjusted, the more precise the outcome of the net is.
